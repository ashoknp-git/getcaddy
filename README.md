# caddy.fast.ai

Simple approach to getting the latest release of the Caddy web server. In your terminal, run:

```bash
curl -s https://caddy.fast.ai | bash
```

Upon completion, you'll find `caddy` in your current directory. (PS: You can then run `upx caddy` if you have [upx](https://upx.github.io/) installed, which will decrease the binary size by >60%.)

See `index.html` in this repo for the script that's run.
